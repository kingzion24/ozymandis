// Package cluster answers one question: how does a machine join this cluster.
//
// It is deliberately small and deliberately separate from the orchestrator.
// The orchestrator seam earns its keep by not knowing which Kubernetes it is
// talking to — it applies workloads, and a Noop implementation stands in for a
// cluster that is not there. K3S_URL and K3S_TOKEN are K3s specifics, so
// putting them behind that seam would be the first crack in it: every future
// distribution would widen an interface that no orchestrator method needs.
