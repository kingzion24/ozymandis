// ReconcileInterval is how often builds are settled against the cluster.
//
// A minute rather than seconds: this exists to catch builds whose process went
// away, which is a rare event, and polling hard for it would cost a query per
// second forever to shorten a wait nobody is sitting through.
const ReconcileInterval = time.Minute

// buildGrace is how long a build may exist before the reconciler will settle
// it on the strength of a missing Job.
//
// Without it there is a race the reconciler would lose: a build row is written
// before the Job is created, so a reconcile landing in that window would see no
// Job, conclude the build had died, and fail a build that was about to start.

// ReconcileBuilds settles builds that claim to be running.
//
// Level-triggered, against the cluster, which is the only arrangement that
// works. A build is driven by a goroutine, and a goroutine is not a source of
// truth: it does not survive a restart, and it never existed on the other
// replicas. The Job does, and every replica can read it — so "is this still
// running" is a lookup rather than a guess about a process.
//
// Safe to run concurrently with the goroutine that started the build, and on
// several replicas at once. Everything here is idempotent and decides from the
// cluster's answer, so two reconcilers reaching the same conclusion write the
