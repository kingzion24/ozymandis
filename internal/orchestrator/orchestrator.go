//
// SEAM 1 of 4. This interface is the primary extension point of the engine.
// The engine ships a single-cluster Kubernetes implementation (subpackage k8s)
// and a no-op implementation for tests. A wrapping application can supply its
// own — for example one that selects a cluster from a registry and applies
// per-owner scheduling — without the engine knowing anything about it.
//
// Two rules keep this seam usable:
//
//  1. No Kubernetes types appear in this package. Everything crossing the
//     boundary is a plain Go type defined here. An implementation backed by
//     something other than Kubernetes stays possible, and callers never import
//     client-go.
//  2. Naming policy lives with the caller, not the implementation. The caller
//     decides namespaces and resource names; implementations only apply them.
//     A wrapping layer needs different naming, and this is what lets it.
