// Package secret keeps values that must survive a database dump.
//
// The engine stores what it needs to re-apply a workload, and some of that is
// a password somebody pasted in. Stored plainly it is in Postgres, in every
// backup, and in whatever the backup was copied to — none of which anybody
// thinks about at the moment they paste it.

// So values are sealed here and only opened to apply. A dump is then useless
// without the key, which lives in configuration rather than in the database it
