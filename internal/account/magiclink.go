// to sign in lands in a fresh empty team and those apps belong to an owner
// nobody can authenticate as — visible only as a dashboard that has lost

// read and acted on inside one transaction holding the team row. Two people
// completing sign-in at the same moment therefore produce exactly one owner:
// the loser takes the second branch and gets a team of their own. The check is
// "has no owner" rather than "has no members" so that an install whose team was
