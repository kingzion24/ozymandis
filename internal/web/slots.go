// Package web serves the engine's dashboard.
//
// SEAM 3 of 4, and the one that is easiest to get wrong. The other three seams
// are Go interfaces, which compose naturally. A rendered HTML page does not:
// you cannot wrap a template in middleware. If the layout hard-codes its own
// sidebar and header, an application built on top of the engine has exactly two
// options — fork the templates, or rewrite the dashboard — and forking breaks
// the rule that the engine must stay runnable on its own.
//
// The fix is to make the chrome data rather than markup. Layout renders slots;
// a SlotProvider fills them. The engine ships a provider with single-owner
// defaults. A wrapping application supplies its own, adding an organisation
// switcher, a balance indicator, or extra navigation, without editing a single
// file in this package.
