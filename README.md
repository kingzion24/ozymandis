# Ozymandis

A self-hosted PaaS for Kubernetes. Deploy your app to your own server, with
real Kubernetes underneath rather than a Docker wrapper, and an all-Go control
plane you can read in an afternoon.

Runs on K3s, so a $5 VPS is enough to start.

> [!WARNING]
> **Not ready for production.** Ozymandis is under active development. Interfaces,
> the database schema, and behaviour all still change without notice, there has

> Run it on something you can afford to lose, and keep backups you have actually
> restored from. Do not put it in front of anything whose downtime or data loss
> would matter.

**What it does today.** You can deploy from a container image or from a Git
repository, give it a domain, attach storage, and watch it from the dashboard.
See [What works today](#what-works-today).

## Why

Existing self-hosted PaaS options mostly wrap Docker Compose or Swarm. That
works until you want health probes, rolling updates, or a second node — at
which point you are fighting the abstraction instead of shipping.

Kubernetes already solves those problems. K3s makes it small enough to run on a
single cheap box. Ozymandis is a control plane over it that stays out of the way:
every workload is an ordinary Deployment, so `kubectl` keeps working and
nothing you build here is locked in.

## What works today

**Shipping an app**

| | |
|---|---|
| Deploy a container image, with env vars and replicas | ✅ |
| Override the image's command, so one image runs as several apps | ✅ |
| Build and deploy from a Git repository, using buildpacks | ✅ |
| Builds run as an isolated Job, with the log kept | ✅ |
| A built-in registry for the images those builds produce | ✅ |
| Scale, redeploy, delete | ✅ |
| Liveness and readiness probes | ✅ |
| Deployment history, with a log per deployment | ✅ |
| App logs, and per-request HTTP logs you can search and page | ✅ |
| Live logs, streamed as the container writes them | ✅ |
| Persistent volumes, mounted and expandable | ✅ |
| Secrets sealed at rest, kept out of the app record | ✅ |
| Deploy a wired stack from a template in one action | ✅ |

**Reaching it**

| | |
|---|---|
| A hostname per app, served the moment it starts | ✅ |
| Custom domains people bring, with verification | ✅ |
| TLS from one shared wildcard certificate | ✅ |

**Running the cluster**

| | |
|---|---|
| Live workload status read from the cluster | ✅ |
| Cluster view — nodes, pods, volumes, events, utilisation | ✅ |
| Add a node, then cordon, drain, or remove one | ✅ |
| Namespace provisioning with enforced security posture | ✅ |
| A project canvas apps can be arranged on | ✅ |

**Accounts and foundations**

| | |
|---|---|
| Magic-link sign-in, sessions, sign-out everywhere | ✅ |
| Teams with Owner / Admin / Member and invitations | ✅ |
| Identity seam — single owner, bearer token, or session | ✅ |
| Dashboard with pluggable chrome, light and dark | ✅ |
| Postgres schema + embedded migrations | ✅ |

Utilisation percentages need `metrics-server` in the cluster. Without it
everything else still works and those figures read `—` rather than zero.

## Install on a VPS

> **Not live yet.** The scripts below are written and tested, but the URLs do
> not serve anything while this repository is private: GitHub Pages is not
> available for private repositories on the free plan, and release assets need
> a token, so an anonymous `curl` gets a 404 from both. They start working the
> day the repository goes public and the first tag is pushed — no change to the
> scripts is needed. Until then, use [Quick start](#quick-start).

```bash
curl -sSL https://kingzion24.github.io/ozymandis/install.sh | sudo sh
```

Debian or Ubuntu, amd64 or arm64. It installs K3s, Postgres, and Ozymandis as a
systemd service, then prints the dashboard URL and a token to sign in with.
About ninety seconds on a fresh box.

To upgrade later:

```bash
curl -sSL https://kingzion24.github.io/ozymandis/upgrade.sh | sudo sh
```

That one only swaps the binary and restarts. If the new version does not come
up healthy it puts the old one back, so a bad release costs a restart rather
than an outage.

| | |
|---|---|
| Binary | `/usr/local/bin/ozymandis` |
| Config | `/etc/ozymandis/ozymandis.env` |
| Service | `systemctl status ozymandis` |
| Logs | `journalctl -u ozymandis -f` |

**Back up `/etc/ozymandis/ozymandis.env`.** It holds `OZYMANDIS_SECRET_KEY`, which seals
your stored secrets and cannot be regenerated — losing it loses them. Re-running
the installer preserves it, and every other generated value, on purpose.

The installer serves the dashboard over plain HTTP, so the token crosses the
network in the clear. Set `OZYMANDIS_BASE_URL` and `OZYMANDIS_APP_DOMAIN` in the config
and put it behind TLS before you rely on it; until then `ssh -L 8080:127.0.0.1:8080`
is the safer way in.

Both scripts are worth reading before you pipe them to a root shell —
[`install.sh`](install.sh) and [`upgrade.sh`](upgrade.sh) are exactly what those
URLs serve, published straight from this repository.

To remove it all:

```bash
sudo systemctl disable --now ozymandis
sudo rm -rf /etc/ozymandis /etc/systemd/system/ozymandis.service /usr/local/bin/ozymandis
sudo /usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh          # only if you want the cluster gone too
sudo -u postgres dropdb ozymandis && sudo -u postgres dropuser ozymandis
```

## Quick start

For development, or to run against a cluster you already have.

Requirements: Go 1.26+, Postgres, and a kubeconfig pointing at a cluster.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kingzion24/ozymandis.git
cd ozymandis

export OZYMANDIS_DATABASE_URL="postgres://ozymandis:ozymandis@localhost:5432/ozymandis?sslmode=disable"
export OZYMANDIS_KUBECONFIG="$HOME/.kube/config"
export OZYMANDIS_AUTH_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 24)"   # omit only on a trusted network

make run
```

Then open <http://localhost:8080>.

Migrations run automatically at startup. If the cluster is unreachable Ozymandis
still boots and says so on the overview page, so you can fix your kubeconfig
without digging through logs.

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `OZYMANDIS_DATABASE_URL` | — | **Required.** Postgres connection string |
| `OZYMANDIS_ADDR` | `:8080` | Listen address |
| `OZYMANDIS_KUBECONFIG` | `$KUBECONFIG` | Path to a kubeconfig |
| `OZYMANDIS_KUBE_IN_CLUSTER` | `false` | Use the mounted service account instead |
| `OZYMANDIS_AUTH_TOKEN` | — | Bearer token. Unset, and with no accounts, means **no authentication** |
| `OZYMANDIS_OWNER_ID` | `owner-local` | The team every resource belongs to on a fresh install |
| `OZYMANDIS_OWNER_EMAIL` | — | The one address that may sign in before anybody has an account |
| `OZYMANDIS_APP_DOMAIN` | — | Apps get `<name>.<this>`. Point `*.<this>` at the cluster |
| `OZYMANDIS_WILDCARD_TLS` | `false` | Serve those hostnames from the controller's default certificate |
| `OZYMANDIS_BASE_URL` | — | Public URL. **Setting it switches sign-in on** |
| `OZYMANDIS_SMTP_ADDR` / `OZYMANDIS_RESEND_API_KEY` | — | How sign-in links are delivered. Neither means they go to the log |
| `OZYMANDIS_DEBUG` | `false` | Verbose logging |

The full list, with the reasoning behind each, is in
[`.env.example`](.env.example).

## Security posture

Workloads are hardened by construction, not by configuration. Every namespace
Ozymandis creates is labelled for Pod Security Admission at `restricted` and gets a
default `LimitRange`; every pod runs with:

- `runAsNonRoot`, `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, `privileged: false`
- all Linux capabilities dropped
- `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault`
- a read-only root filesystem, with a writable `/tmp` so that stays practical
- no service account token mounted

There is no API for privileged containers, host networking, or host paths —
not as an omission to be filled in later, but because a request for them has
nowhere to go. Images that genuinely need a writable root filesystem have one
explicit, visible escape hatch (`WritableRootFilesystem`).

An important consequence: **images that run as root will not start.** That is
the intended behaviour. Most official images already ship a non-root user.

## Architecture

Ozymandis is built to be wrapped. Anything that needs to differ for a hosted,
multi-tenant deployment goes through one of three seams, so a larger
application can build on this module rather than fork it:

| Seam | Interface | Engine ships | A wrapper supplies |
|---|---|---|---|
| Orchestration | `orchestrator.Orchestrator` | single cluster | multi-cluster placement |
| Identity | `identity.Provider` | single owner, bearer token | tokens resolved to an account |
| Dashboard chrome | `web.SlotProvider` | plain navigation | account switcher, usage, billing |

Two rules keep the seams honest:

1. **No Kubernetes types cross the orchestrator boundary.** Callers never
   import `client-go`, and a non-Kubernetes backend stays possible.
2. **Every table carries `owner_id`, and unique constraints are scoped by it.**
   The engine writes one value there forever. It exists so that scoping is a
   cheap indexed predicate rather than a join added later — a predicate is a
   check that gets written, a join is a check that gets skipped.

```
cmd/ozymandis             entrypoint and wiring
internal/app          workload lifecycle — keeps database and cluster agreeing
internal/account      people: users, teams, roles, invitations
internal/cluster      how a machine joins this cluster
internal/config       environment configuration
internal/domain       hostnames — the one we issue, and the ones people bring
internal/notify       delivers messages to people
internal/registry     where images this install builds are pushed
internal/secret       values that must survive a database dump
internal/identity     SEAM 2 — who owns this request
internal/orchestrator SEAM 1 — the runtime contract
          └── k8s     Kubernetes implementation
internal/store        schema, embedded migrations, sqlc queries
internal/web          SEAM 3 — dashboard, slot-based layout
```

The database is the source of truth for which apps exist; the cluster is the
source of truth for how they are doing. Neither is asked the other's question,
which is why listing apps never enumerates Deployments and why status is never
cached in a column that can go stale.

## Development

```bash
make assets     # templ codegen + Tailwind
make check      # vet + tests
make build
make dev        # rebuild and run
```

`templ` and `sqlc` are Go tool dependencies, and `make css` downloads the
**Tailwind standalone CLI** — a single binary, no Node or npm. So a contributor
needs nothing installed beyond Go.

Generated `*_templ.go` files and the compiled `app.css` are both committed,
which keeps plain `go build` working for anyone who has not run codegen. CI
rebuilds both and fails on drift.

### Design system

The UI uses the [templUI](https://templui.io) / shadcn token set — the same
CSS custom properties, so a component copied in with `templui add <name>`
inherits this theme unchanged. Deliberate departures:

- **Monochrome primary.** A saturated primary button reads as consumer
  software. Colour is reserved for state, where it carries information.
- **Denser than stock.** 13px base, tighter rows, borders instead of shadows,
  a metric strip instead of a grid of stat cards.
- **Status is a dot and a word**, not a filled pill. A page of coloured pills
  is noise, and the one that matters stops standing out.

Light and dark both ship, resolved before first paint so there is no flash on
navigation.

### Visual states

Every state the dashboard can be in — degraded workloads, failed deploys, a
node at 98%, an unreachable cluster — renders from a gallery, without needing a
cluster or a database:

```bash
OZYMANDIS_GALLERY_OUT=/tmp/gallery go test ./internal/web -run Gallery
```

Those are the states that silently rot, because nobody sees them until a
customer does. The generated gallery can be reviewed directly from its output
directory.

Tests use the `client-go` fake clientset, so the full orchestration path —
namespaces, security context, apply idempotency, status — is verified without
a cluster.
